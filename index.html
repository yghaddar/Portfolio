      <p>Hey! I am a web designer and develeper from <i>Detroit Michigan</i></p>
      <p>
        Previous to my career in web development and design I worked as a digital marketer. I have worked on many teams and have led a few as well, both are important and should be experinced in the professional field. This has allowed me to get a true understanding of what is needed from wesbites such as <ul><li>Website Traffic</li><li>Responsivness</li><li>Consumer Needs</li><li>Lead Generation</li><li>Content Creation</li></ul>
      </p>

      <section class = "personal-life"> 
        Apart from being an avid developer I am also a <sup>FITNESS</sup> and <sub>TRAVEL</sub> enthuenist. These have both brought me a strong and open mindset when it comes to work ethic and being an open-minded indivdual with different perspectives on life.
